Guidelines: SQLite Database Operations: Catching Errors and Performing CRUD Operations
This guide explains step by step how to catch errors and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations when working with SQLite database in Android apps.

In the code example, the following operations are performed:

Create the Musicians table (checks existing table if available)
Adding new musicians
Update musician information
Musician deletion
